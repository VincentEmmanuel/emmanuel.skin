                <h2>What Are Comedogenic Ingredients?</h2>
                <p>Comedogenic ingredients are substances that have a tendency to clog pores, which can lead to acne breakouts. The term comes from "comedones," the medical name for clogged pores (blackheads and whiteheads).</p>
                <p>These ingredients form a barrier on the skin that can trap oil, dead skin cells, and bacteria inside your pores, potentially causing inflammation and acne.</p>

                <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Are all oils comedogenic?</h3>
                    <p>No! Some oils like jojoba oil, squalane, and mineral oil are non-comedogenic. However, coconut oil, wheat germ oil, and linseed oil are highly comedogenic.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Does "non-comedogenic" on the label mean it's safe?</h3>
                    <p>Not necessarily. The term "non-comedogenic" is not regulated, so companies can use it even if their products contain pore-clogging ingredients. Always check the ingredients list yourself.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>What rating should I avoid?</h3>
                    <p>If you're acne-prone, try to avoid ingredients rated 3-5, especially if they appear in the first 7 ingredients (which means they're present in higher concentrations).</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Can non-comedogenic products still cause acne?</h3>
                    <p>Yes. Acne can be caused by many factors including hormones, bacteria, stress, and diet. However, removing comedogenic products from your routine can significantly help.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>How accurate is this checker?</h3>
                    <p>This tool is based on scientific research including the landmark Fulton (1989) study and data from Acne.org. However, individual reactions vary - what clogs pores for one person may be fine for another.</p>

                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h3>Should I check my shampoo and conditioner too?</h3>
                    <p>Yes! Hair products can transfer to your face, back, and chest, causing breakouts. Check everything that might touch your skin.</p>
